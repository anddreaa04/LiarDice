			 LiarDice is a game of chance. The goal is to obtain a larger number than your opponent.
		</item>
        <item>
			1.	To roll the dice, shake the device.
		</item>
        <item>
			2.	Once you have thrown, the result will be sent to the opponent\'s device, in the form
            of vibration. Your device will receive the result of your opponent, in the same way.

		</item>
        <item>
			3.	Count the vibrations, silently. These are separated by a small amount of time, which
            allows you to count the same number as many times as you need.
		</item>
        <item>
			4.	Try to convince your opponent to throw again (or not) if you think their number may
            be bigger than yours.
		</item>
        <item>

			5.	Once you decide that you are not going to throw more, press the “Stop throwing” button.
            You will 	not be able to pass the round until both of you have hit the button.
            The game has 3 rounds.

		</item>
        <item>
			6.	The winner is the player who wins the most rounds.
